PROJECT OVERVIEW

Daystar Daycare Center is envisioned as a premier facility dedicated to providing a secure, 

nurturing, and stimulating environment for young children. The center will operate under a welldefined management structure, with clearly assigned roles for a manager and babysitters. The 

manager will be central to the daily operations, responsible for overseeing all aspects of the 

daycare, from managing staff and children to handling finances and ensuring smooth daily 

routines. Babysitters will be entrusted with the direct care of the children, engaging them in ageappropriate activities, ensuring their safety and well-being, and providing a comforting and 

supportive presence. Efficient operation will be supported by a robust financial system that tracks 

income from parental payments, manages expenses including staff salaries and operational costs, 

and ensures sound budgeting practices. To streamline these operations and enhance overall 

efficiency, a software solution is proposed to automate key processes, improve communication, 

and provide data-driven insights for better management and decision-making
